          <em><h2>Fight Club</h2></em>
          <p>
            Fight Club is a 1999 American film directed by David Fincher and starring Brad Pitt, 
            Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter. It is based on the 1996 novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. 
            Norton plays the unnamed narrator, who is discontented with his white-collar job. He forms a "fight club" 
            with soap salesman Tyler Durden (Pitt), and becomes embroiled in a relationship with him and a destitute woman, Marla Singer.
            Palahniuk's novel was optioned by Fox 2000 Pictures producer Laura Ziskin, who hired Jim Uhls to write the film adaptation. 
            Fincher was selected because of his enthusiasm for the story. He developed the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting 
            advice from the cast and others in the film industry. He and the cast compared the film to Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and 
            The Graduate (1967), with a theme of conflict between Generation X and the value system of advertising.

          <em><h2>Inception</h2></em>
          <p>
            Inception is a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, 
            who also produced the film with his wife, Emma Thomas. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a professional 
            thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious of his targets. He is offered a chance to have 
            his criminal history erased as payment for the implantation of another person's idea into a target's subconscious.
             After the 2002 completion of Insomnia, Nolan presented to Warner Bros. a written 80-page treatment for a horror film 
              envisioning "dream stealers," based on lucid dreaming. Deciding he needed more experience before tackling a production 
               magnitude and complexity, Nolan retired the project and instead worked on 2005's Batman Begins, 2006's The Prestige,
                and The Dark Knight in 2008. The treatment was revised over 6 months and was purchased by Warner in February 2009. 
                Inception was filmed in six countries, beginning in Tokyo on June 19 and ending in Canada on November 22.
